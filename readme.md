Just put the target problem in the url section of code amd let this bad boy scrape everything from the problem page

returns everything in a nice json

Usage: 

```bash
python boss.py "problem-link-here"
```

developed so I can scrape codeforces problems to my [pet project](https://github.com/nubskr/codespace)
